Soundkiss recording studio service and legacy page

![Website shown on different display sizes](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/soundkissresponsivedisplay.png)

## Project goals

The goal of this project website is to create a web page for the recording studio I used to run in Taipei, Taiwan ROC, named Soundkiss.

With this actual business in mind, I have three goals in mind for this project.

The first is to create a sample webpage that details all of the services the studio offered to potential clients. For this I imagined a clear and concise site that would sell our services and inspire potential clients to make contact.

The second goal, since much of my personal creative output as a recording engineer and producer stems from my time working at Soundkiss, was to create an about page that showcases some of the creative product I helped to create.

Thirdly, I hoped that when I create a personal webpage, I would be able to integrate this site as record of the studio.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

As a primarily English speaking musician or creative requiring audio services in Taiwan, when searching online for local options I want to see somewhere that is shown to be both professional and inviting, offers interest grabbing services and actual samples of creative products that appeal to me.

As a Chinese speaking local user I would want to see a Mandarin version of this site, but having discussed this with my mentor at the outset, we decided best to focus solely on an English language version.

## First Time Visitor

As a First Time Visitor:

1. I want my first impression of the site's design to be positive and the site to instil a sense of professionalism, creativity and energy.

2. I want to be reassured that this company and site are trustworthy and credible.

3. I want to easily understand the services being provided and how I can contact the studio management if I have questions.

4. I want to see examples of the creative output of other artists who have used the facility.

5. I want my curiosity to be fired enough to want to make contact and enquire about next steps of engagement.

## Returning and Frequent Visitor requirements and expectations

As a Returning and Frequent visitor:

1. Most important is that I can immediately contact the company and find the necessary contact information required. This may be required on the move and should be made as accessible and visible as possible.

2. See the latest projects and media associated with the studio.

3. See the latest equipment and services on offer.

## Design Choices - Inspirations

Having only ever designed one website prior to this, at the project outset I immediately looked for inspiration online.

[awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com) showcases some incredible designs and one of the few music related sites that resonated with me was [Pias.com](https://www.pias.com/).

This site employs a classic black(#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) colour scheme with great images and javascript media.

Although much of the content is way beyond my fledgling skills and the scope of this first project, I was inspired by how the website presented a lot of content on a single page, but managed to keep the design clean and clear.
I was particularly impressed with the design of their video media player, which I had hoped to draw design impetus from, but it proved a challenge too much for me to begin!

## Design Choices - Lessons

[Pias.com](https://www.pias.com/) is also an example a website that is full of animation and interactive elements, and I decided that for my studio site many of these would be redundant and perhaps viewed as trying just a little too hard to impress. The ultimate goal of my website is to promote direct ‘personal’ contact, and if anything too much detail feels quite impersonal and overwhelming.

## Design Mk1

From the outset I decided I wanted to use bootstrap in this project, and with the recent release of Bootstrap 5 Beta, I thought I would try the latest version.

Browsing Bootstrap's documentation I decided on a single page design, which I thought I would build using Accordion architecture to allow users to select what content they would like to see. Below is the wireframe for the site.

![Soundkiss Studio initial website design](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/soundkisswire1.png)

I wanted to lead with the studio logo as hero image, as who doesn't like an eye catching and bold design? A second reason is that this image was used on all of our company business cards, emails and creative output, so immediate brand recognition and reinforcement could be achieved by its inclusion.

I created this site but discovered that actually the Bootstrap accordion as a mainframe was confusing, uninviting and turned out to be frustrating to use.

After discussing the failures of this website with my tutor, I decided to start over with a new design.

## Design Mk2

Now much more familiar with Bootstrap architecture having created one site, I decided on a two page design which would meet the project brief.

![Soundkiss Studio draft website design 1](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/soundkissdraft2.png)

I made very basic wireframes, and then scribbled on paper as I worked. I discovered that the main challenge was trying to find images from my archive that would work on the site and fulfil different roles.

For the first page I kept the logo hero image and incorporated some photo media as content links.

For the second I did not have a solution, but then I thought I could utilise icons, which ended up in the final design.

You can see in this wireframe for the about page, I had not quite got there.

![Soundkiss Studio draft website design 2](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/soundkissdraft3.png)

### Colors

I therefore decided on keeping my design clean and concise. I decided black and white text and plain backgrounds as shown on my wireframes would provide good contrast to the images and media I would present.

Favouring opacity changes to show clickable content, I used Cornflower Blue (#6495e) paired with a tetradic pallette related medium Aquamarine (#64edbc) for hover class icons on the about page.

![Tetradic pallette](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/tetradic-cornflower.png?raw=true)

Sourced from ![colorhexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/6495ed)

This calm and lively color combination highlights the icons as clickable links.

### Typography

Having explored several font choices and combinations I settled on Roboto Slab from Google Fonts for its chunky rounded headings.
This was paired with Roboto, the font family being described on the Google Fonts site as possessing:

 >‘a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves.’

Science and the personal are at the heart of recording, and as a recommended google pairing this combination seems to fit well. Sans Serif was selected as the fallback font.

### Icons

Utilising bootstrap in the creation of this site I used their newly released Bootstrap Icons v1.2.0 package.

Finding the selection sometimes not suitable, I have also used icons from FontAwesome.

## Images and Photo Media

With a couple of exceptions, all the images utilised in this project belong to me.

When I was still in Taiwan I commissioned [Toto Kuo](https://totokuophotography.com/), a photographer friend, to take photos at various points during the evolution of the studio and these I’ve utilised for the included photo media.

Other images include my backstage photo by [Sundance Lee](https://www.flickr.com/people/sundancelee/), and my on stage concert shot by [YC Lin](<https://blueballoonstudio.blogspot.com/>), who have both previously granted me permission to utilise these for my personal use.

### Logo

When I first established the studio I commissioned a company logo to be designed by [Pia Hsieh](https://alfunsety.wixsite.com/impia), an artist friend. This was based on something I imagined, which is the focused and precise but still vibrant motion in which a hummingbird draws nectar from a flower.

Next, imagining sound as a flower emerging from a speaker, there’s the logo! If you hadn’t guessed already, the hummingbird represents me as sound engineer and I know Leonard Cohen was also very fond of them as a subject.

![Soundkiss logo](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/soundkiss.jpg)

Since the logo continues to exist on albums and online media that refers to the studio, I wanted to continue using it. Even though now I’d choose a rebrand, it still is distinctive and as a graphic, also provides nice contrast to the website’s photo media.

## Visual Hierarchy

This site is designed so that the top area presents representative elements of all the page has to offer, minimising the need for cursory scrolling.

Taking a three step, top down approach,

1. The site begins with the Navbar, clearly showing the three pages of the site which are designed for different user interests.
Home for the unfamiliar browser who wants to find out about the business and what services are offered.
About for anyone interested in works produced by the studio.
Contacts for clients who need information immediately or to prepare for visiting.

2. For the Home and about pages, immediately below the hero and title respectively are icons linking to page content. Desired content can be visited directly.

3. Contact links are provided via the fixed footer to facilitate contact.

## Languages Used

HTML5
CSS
Javascript (Via Bootstrap)

## Tools, Frameworks, Libraries and Programs used

[Atom](https://atom.io): version 1.54 was used as code editor. I cloned my Github repository after some internet issues and pushed most of my work from this environment.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com): used to create wireframes during design and redesign

[Bootstrap 5.0.0 Beta 1](https://getbootstrap.com): I used the latest release of Bootstrap to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website. I discovered that it was so new documentation about new features was sometimes limited. I did however refer a great deal to the Bootstrap 5 website documentation and examples.

[Bootstrap Icons v1.3.0](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) - Bootstrap’s own icon set was employed for the navbar social media icons and footer icons.

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.ca/intl/en_ca/chrome/) - Google Chrome’s browser inspect feature was used to check website responsiveness and error check code.

[Font-awesome Version 5.15.2](https://fontawesome.com)  - Font awesome icons were used for the about page icons below the title and bandcamp icon for selected recordings.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)- Roboto and Roboto Slab were imported to the document’s header via links and referenced in CSS.

[Git](https://www.gitpod.io)- Was used when contacting student support and for version control.

[Github](https://github.com/)- Used to store the project code pushed from Git.

Apple Preview- Used for photo editing

[Procreate](https://procreate.art/)- Was used for creating notes and wireframes on my ipad.

## Testing User Stories from (UX) section

### Revisiting first time User goals

1. I want my first impression of the site's design to be positive and the site to instil a sense of professionalism, creativity and energy.

- The user is greeted by a clean design featuring the studio logo, which may perhaps already be familiar by a business card or media reference for example. The animation offers a welcome message welcoming the user to the studio, and the overall feeling is that care and consideration has gone into the website design, reflecting on the professionalism of the organisation.

- Immediately below the hero are links detailing the studio services.

2. I want to be reassured that this company and site are trustworthy and credible.

- Viewing the services page, I can see the studio space and equipment well presented. There are several options to make contact and if I had any questions or queries I have the opportunity to ask the organisation directly.

- Also if the user explores the about section they will find a showcase of creative output that shows the professional standard and range of work which has been created.

3. I want to easily understand the services being provided and how I can contact the studio management if I have questions.

- Beneath the home page hero the services offered by the studio are detailed and links for further information provided. These links enable immediate access to desired information, and contact information to made direct contact with the studio is immediately accessible throughout.

4. I want to see examples of the creative output of other artists who have used the facility.

- The about section documents creative product and awards associated with the studio, and all of these are present, clearly demonstrating the competence of the organisation.

5. I want my curiosity to be fired enough to want to make contact and enquire about next steps of engagement.

- There is enough variety of content to illicit a response from interested users. Whether it be a recording from an artist they like, a video, studio photos or information about a service, all of these are clearly and creatively presented.


### Revisiting frequent of returning User goals

As a Returning and Frequent visitor:

1. Most important is that I can immediately contact the company and find the necessary contact information required. This may be required on the move and should be made as accessible and visible as possible.

- Contact is available via email form, email and phone links throughout the site, and the studio clearly welcomes users to contact. The contact info is available from the moment the site loads.

2. See the latest projects and media associated with the studio.

- In the about section, projects and associated media are all clearly presented.

3. See the latest equipment and services on offer.

- A separate downloadable sample PDF was created so users could download information about equipment for sale and hire, and allow the website manager to regularly update this without changing the website design.

- Services clearly require contacting the studio as the nature of the business.

## Testing

The website was tested on popular browsers incluing Google Chrome, Safari, Opera and Mozilla Firefox.

A live link to the website was also made available on Slack channel peer code review!

[Peer code review](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/peercodereview.png)

Several users commented and complimented the website, with no glitches reported.

### HTML Test

Html code was tested using the [W3 HTML Validator](<https://validator.w3.org/>)

#### HTML Test Errors

Detected errors are shown in the following screenshots:

![HTML result 1](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/htmltest1.png)
![HTML result 2](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/htmltest2.png)
![HTML result 3](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/htmltest3.png)

#### HTML Test Fixes

1.Stray end tag div was removed from code.

2.Html comments were modified.

The code was then retested and received the green light.

![HTML Index Pass](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/htmlvalidatorsuccess.png)

The about page contains one warning due to the absence of a header element in the icons section.

![HTML About Pass](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/htmlvalidator2.png)


### CSS Test

CSS was tested using the W3C CSS Validator Services

[CSS Validator] - (<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator>)

#### CSS Test Errors

![CSS result 1](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/cssvalresult1.png)

![CSS result 2](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/cssvalresult2.png)

#### CSS Test Error Fixes

I discussed these errors with my tutor and they are bootstrap related. I have therefore not corrected anything.

#### CSS Test Warnings

![CSS result 3](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/csswarning.png)

#### CSS Test Warning Fixes

I discussed these warnings with my tutor and he recommended that I remove the animation classes if I wanted the warnings gone. These animations however are important for the presentation of the site and at this time I will leave them in with the hope that I can understand going forward what better approaches may exist regarding using CSS animations.

## Accessibility Testing

Google lighthouse and Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool were used to test the site’s accessibility

[Google Lighthouse](<https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse>)

[Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/)

### Accessibility Testing results - WAVE

![Wave Results for index.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/waveresults.png)

![Wave Results for about.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/waveresultsabout.png)

#### WAVE Errors

index.html
1 X Linked image missing title on Back to top arrow icon - CORRECTED
5 x Missing title text on Nav bar social media icons and logo - CORRECTED

about.html
The above errors were also present on the about page.

In addition the tool flagged up 6 x Selected recording icon links without title texts - CORRECTED

With these error addressed these were the results.

![Wave Errors corrected for index.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/wavetestcompleteindex.png)

![Wave Errors corrected for about.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/wavetestcompleteabout.png)



#### WAVE Alerts

index.html

1. 2 x Alerts for skipped heading level at my page icons.
2. 3 x Alerts for links to PDF documents.

about.html

1. 2 X Skipped heading level in Associated media section
2. 2 X Suspicious link text
3. 1 X Redundant link
4. 9 X YouTube video
5. 3 x contrast errors

#### WAVE Test Fixes

index.html

1. I have modified the h3 heading to h2 for my page links and the corresponding CSS styles.
2. The PDF document links I have left as is for this project, but I am now aware of the accessibility issues related to using PDFs.

about.html

1. Headings were changed from h3 to h2
2. Text for links was changed from 'here' to more descriptive titles as suggested
3. The redundant link refers to the Home tab in the navbar. I have left this.
4. The Youtube video links are required to have video captions. At this time I have left this but where possible I will see if Youtube's automatic Closed captions can be applied.
5. The contrast errors refer to the top of page icons, stating they do not contrast enough against the background. These I have also chosen to leave, but will be more informed about my choices of colour for visually impaired users going forward.

### Accessibility Test results - Google Lighthouse

#### Mobile

![Google Lighthouse Results for index.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/lighthousedesktopabout.png)

### Accessibility Test Analysis - Google Lighthouse

Immediately after performing the above tests I reran the desktop test on index.html

![Google Lighthouse Results for index.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/lighthousedesktopindex2.png)

As you can see the performance increased 6 points from the previous result 60 to 66. I consider this figure may be tied to Github as host site and would be interested to see what the results would be when applied to a private commercial host server.

Overall the results are positive and the website scores highly on accessibility, which I'm sure is in part due to the changes made after using WAVE.

Performance is lowest scoring across the board, and reviewing the suggested changes performance gains could be made if I optimised the website images for their display size.

Reviewing all categories, consistently it is the mixed image sizing that causes issues.

### Responsiveness Testing

Responsiveness was tested using first [Responsinator](<https://www.responsinator.com/>)

The results proved strange, showing multiple additional elements across several devices.

![Responsinator Results for index.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/responseresults.png)

I rechecked my code and discovered a missing < element was responsible. Responsiveness was rechecked and everything appeared fine.

![Responsinator Results for index.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/responseresults2.png)

![Responsinator Results for about.html](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/responseresults3.png)

I rechecked the website using [Google Device Mode](<https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode>) mode across a number of devices and encountered no issues.

## Bugs

During the development of this website I encountered a couple of glitches.

### Tooltips

Using Bootstrap 5 I wished to utilise the native tooltip class on this site, and after importing them via popper and applying to the icons on my about page, they displayed but the icons appeared strange.

```Html
<!-- About Icons -->
<section id="about-icons">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row mb-5 mt-5 justify-content-md-center about-icons">
      <div class="col text-center">
        <a href="#records" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Selected Recordings" class="fas fa-compact-disc fade-in fa-4x"></a>
      </div>
      <div class="col text-center">
        <a href="#videos" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Selected Video Media" class="fas fa-video fade-in fa-4x"></a>
      </div>
      <div class="col text-center">
        <a href="#media" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Related External Links" class="fas fa-external-link-alt fade-in fa-4x"></a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

![This code resulted in the fontawesome icons being displayed with strange artefacts](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/abouticonbug.png)

After trying several solutions I consulted with my mentor Reuben and he discovered that by inserting a <span> class, that the issue was resolved. The tooltips and icons displayed correctly.

```Html
<section id="about-icons">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row mb-5 mt-5 justify-content-md-center about-icons">
      <div class="col text-center">
        <a href="#records">
          <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Selected Recordings" class="fas fa-compact-disc fade-in fa-4x"></span>
        </a>
      </div>
      <div class="col text-center">
        <a href="#videos">
          <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Selected Video Media" class="fas fa-video fade-in fa-4x"></span>
        </a>
      </div>
      <div class="col text-center">
        <a href="#media">
          <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Related External Links" class="fas fa-external-link-alt fade-in fa-4x"></span>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

![This code resulted in the fontawesome icons being displayed correctly](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/abouticonbugsolution.png)

- Hero image and overlay

Utilising the approach demonstrated in the Whiskey Drop class, I created a hero image with overlay. I discovered that it did not display correctly on smaller media.

![iphone5](https://github.com/alexjohnives/soundkissstudio/blob/master/assets/images/herobug.png)

This I discovered was not a bug, but that I had not applied a media query to change the display of this element.

I contacted tutor support who were very helpful in advising me what resources I could use to fix the issue, particularly this w3schools(<https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp>) article.

Key in the end to resolving this issue was the following media query

```Css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    #hero-image {
        background-size: contain;
        width: 100vw;
        height: 50vh;
        margin-bottom: 3rem;
        margin-top: 1rem;
    }
    .services img {
      width: 12rem;
      height: 12rem;
    }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
.sm-icons .nav-item {
  text-align: center;
}
}
```

I set the max-width to 768px to match Bootstrap's medium breakpoint value, and the image now displayed correctly.
